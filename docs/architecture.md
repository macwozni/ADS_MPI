## Current Problem API

Each migrated problem follows this structure:

```text
problems/<problem>/input_data.F90   Command-line parameters and problem data
problems/<problem>/RHS_fun.F90      Pointwise forcing callback
problems/<problem>/*_solver.F90     Optional problem-local solver
problems/<problem>/main.F90         Driver
problems/<problem>/GNUmakefile      Local build/run contract
```

The active callback has the signature:

```fortran
function forcing(un, du, X) result(ret)
   real(kind = 8), intent(in) :: un
   real(kind = 8), intent(in), dimension(3) :: du
   real(kind = 8), intent(in), dimension(3) :: X
   real(kind = 8) :: ret
end function forcing
```

Problem-local legacy `RHS_eq.F90` files may still exist as references, but the
active source lists in the problem-local GNUmakefiles use `RHS_fun.F90`. The
shared quadrature-level RHS assembly lives in `src/RHS_eq.F90`.

## Time Integration Schemes

There are two ADS time-advancement paths:

- `Step` is the single-step Forward Euler path. Its `alpha_step = 1` is
  intentional and should not be treated as a Douglas-Gunn or ADI scheme.
- `MultiStep` is the three-substep directional path used by iGRM time schemes.

The implemented time-scheme wrappers are:

```text
ForwardEuler3DStep          3D Forward Euler wrapper
DouglasGunn3DStep           3D Douglas-Gunn wrapper
PeacemanRachford3DStep      3D cyclic Peaceman-Rachford wrapper
BackwardEuler3DStep         3D split Backward Euler wrapper
```

`ForwardEuler3DStep` delegates to `Step`. The iGRM/ADI path is configured
once before the time loop and then reused through a persistent `TimeScheme3D`
object. Use the persistent configurators in `src/time_scheme.F90`:

- `ConfigureDouglasGunn3DTimeScheme`
- `ConfigurePeacemanRachford3DTimeScheme`
- `ConfigureBackwardEuler3DTimeScheme`
- `ConfigureMassOnly3DTimeScheme`

The `*TimeScheme` configurators fill `TimeScheme3D` with the RHS coefficient
table, the RHS derivative-state selector, and the directional LHS mixing table.
Time loops should call the named DG/PR/BE wrappers with that existing object,
not rebuild scheme coefficients every step. The lower level
`ConfigureDouglasGunn3D`, `ConfigurePeacemanRachford3D`, and
`ConfigureBackwardEuler3D` routines remain available for callers that need raw
coefficient tables.

The active iGRM direction keeps the residual-minimization gram block mass-only,
while the scheme operator is applied through the coupling blocks. This avoids
singular mixed iGRM stiffness blocks.

iGRM space compatibility is checked once during problem setup with
`ValidateIGRMTimeSchemeSpaces`; it is not repeated inside each time-step
wrapper.

The iGRM/ADI configurators are diffusion-oriented by default. They accept an
optional `include_transport` flag for first-derivative transport terms; the
`pure_diffusion_igrm` driver configures its scheme with
`include_transport=.false.`.

## iGRM Mesh Assumptions

The shared mixed iGRM matrix path used by the scalar problems assumes:

- the test and trial spaces use the same geometric mesh,
- repeated knots are allowed and do not change the geometric mesh,
- the test degree is greater than the trial degree.

In other words, the distinct knot locations must match, while knot
multiplicities may differ. `igrm_stokes` uses its own DG facet assembler and
therefore permits equal test and trial degrees while retaining different
continuities. `igrm_pollution` likewise owns its DPG assembly locally and
accepts independently configured conforming trial/test continuities.
